					I am a freelance model with a variety of experience covering a wide range of different levels. 
					I am originally from Vietnam but currently based in Cambridgeshire, UK. 
					I can travel easily to London, Birmingham and the rest of the UK easily and I am often on tour as I enjoy travelling. 
					If you would like to work with me then please check out my booking information which sets out my terms and conditions, 
					my calendar to see when and where I am touring and my contact page to get in touch and I will get back to you as soon as possible. 
				</p>
				<p className="hometext">
					I also frequently travel further afield as I have yet to fully explore this part of the world and happy to try 
					new places if there is enough interest in that location. 
					Countries I have not yet visited include Switzerland, Germany and Scandinavia. 
					If you are interest in my travelling outside of the Schengen area then I may need a visa and so plenty of notice would be appreciated. 
				</p>
				<p className="hometext">
					I am currently modelling full time, having just finished my Masterâ€™s Degree. 
					However, this is likely to change in the near future so if you would like to work with me, now is a good time to do so.
